# üèÜ FPL Studio

> **Advanced Fixture Difficulty Analysis for Fantasy Premier League**

A modern, data-driven tool for analyzing FPL fixture difficulty with dynamic ratings that go beyond the basic FPL difficulty scores.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Dynamic Studio FDR System**

Our advanced fixture difficulty rating system uses multiple data sources and sophisticated calculations:

**üßÆ Multi-Factor Calculation Engine:**

- **Base Team Strength (60%)**: Uses all 6 FPL strength metrics with intelligent scaling
- **Season Performance (25%)**: Points per game vs expected, goal difference trends
- **Recent Form (10%)**: Weighted analysis of last 5 matches with opponent strength adjustment
- **Home Advantage (5%)**: Venue-specific performance boosts

**üìä Multiple Difficulty Views:**

- **Studio Overall**: Balanced view combining all factors
- **Studio Attack**: Emphasizes opponent defensive strength (for attacking returns)
- **Studio Defence**: Emphasizes opponent attacking strength (for clean sheets)
- **FPL Default**: Original ratings for comparison

**üéöÔ∏è Dynamic Weighting System:**

- **Early Season**: Higher reliance on base FPL strength ratings
- **Mid Season**: Balanced integration of performance data
- **Late Season**: Heavy weighting on actual season performance

**üéØ Confidence System:**

- **High**: 15+ games played, consistent performance data
- **Medium**: 8+ games, reasonable sample size
- **Low**: Limited data, early season fixtures

### üìä **Interactive Fixture Grid**

- **Sortable columns** by team name or attractiveness score
- **Team filtering** to focus on specific clubs
- **Gameweek selection** (1-19 weeks ahead)
- **Detailed fixture popovers** with:
    - Opponent strength and form analysis
    - Recent head-to-head record (W/D/L + goals)
    - Precise kickoff times
    - Club badges and team information
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop and mobile

### üé® **Visual Design**

- **Smart color coding**: Different scales for FPL (1-5) vs Studio (continuous) ratings
- **Sticky headers and score columns** for easy comparison while scrolling
- **Dark/light theme support** with system preference detection
- **Club badges** with fallback handling and optimization
- **Modern UI** using shadcn/ui components

### üî¢ **Advanced Attractiveness Scoring**

Our proprietary scoring system evaluates fixture runs comprehensively:

- **Base difficulty scoring** with inverted scale (easier = higher score)
- **Double/Triple gameweek bonuses** that properly value multiple fixtures
- **Blank gameweek penalties** to account for missing fixtures
- **Weighted gameweek analysis** showing best/worst periods
- **Summary statistics** including singles/doubles/triples breakdown

## üß† How Studio FDR Works

### **1. Base Strength Calculation**

Uses all 6 FPL strength metrics (overall/attack/defence √ó home/away) with intelligent normalization:

```typescript
function normalizeStrengthToDifficulty(strength: number): number {
	const minStrength = 1000
	const maxStrength = 1400
	const clampedStrength = Math.max(minStrength, Math.min(maxStrength, strength))
	return 1 + (4 * (clampedStrength - minStrength)) / (maxStrength - minStrength)
}
```

### **2. Season Performance Integration**

Compares actual performance vs expected based on FPL strength:

- **Points per game** vs league-adjusted expectations
- **Goal difference** trends and efficiency
- **Home/away** specific performance where data available
- **Sample size weighting** for confidence adjustment

### **3. Form Analysis**

Sophisticated recent form calculation:

- **Last 5 matches** with recency weighting (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2)
- **Opponent strength adjustment** for context
- **Result and performance quality** (goals scored/conceded, win quality)
- **Home advantage correction** (5% discount/bonus)

### **4. Dynamic Weighting by Season Stage**

The system adapts its reliance on different factors:

**Early Season (GW 1-5):**

- Base: 80%, Season: 5%, Form: 10%, Home: 5%

**Mid Season (GW 6-15):**

- Base: 60-80%, Season: 5-25%, Form: 15%, Home: 5%

**Late Season (GW 16+):**

- Base: 50%, Season: 35%, Form: 10%, Home: 5%

### **5. Confidence Intervals**

Every rating includes uncertainty bounds based on:

- **Sample size**: More games = higher confidence
- **Season stage**: Early season = higher uncertainty
- **Adjustment magnitude**: Large adjustments = lower confidence
